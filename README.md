This is the bundled mdbook for all of the phases we went through during the course Process and Safety of the minor Industrial Automation at Saxion University of Applied Sciences during the first semester of the 2023/2024 school year.

The group consisted of the following students:
- Mike Kamerman
- Mats Heusinkveld
- Daan Homma
- Mark Holtjer

During the project, the goal is to design a robot set-up that would be able to assemble a gas valve autonomously.
